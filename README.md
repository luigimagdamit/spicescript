# Ice Spice Programming Language

The Ice Spice programming language is a language designed to emulate the speaking style of the artist "Ice Spice." This language is intended to be used for fun and entertainment purposes only, and is not intended for serious programming projects.

## Syntax

The syntax of the Ice Spice programming language is designed to be similar to the way Ice Spice speaks in her music and interviews. Here is an overview of the language syntax:

- The language is inspired by RPN and Forth, meaning that most operations occur as postfix.
- Variables are declared with the keyword "like".
-  Variables can be assigned using the syntax `name value like `.
- Boolean variables occur as ``in_ha_mood`` being ``True`` and ``boys_a_liar`` being ``False``
- Parentheses are used to group expressions together, but they don't actually do anything. Just use it for style.

- The `hold_on` keyword is used to concatenate strings. Strings can only be declared as single words because Ice is just consise like that.
- The `damn` keyword is used to indicate frustration or disappointment. It is also used as a boolean comparison operator similar to ``==``
- The `duhduhduh` keyword is used to indicate agreement or confirmation. Just kidding, its used as an end marker in conditional statements.

Here is an example program in the Ice Spice programming language. Also note that the program file requires the header ``you_thought_i_was_feelin_u?``or else it will not run.

```
you_thought_i_was_feelin_u?
### mandatory header

soni hello world hold_on 
### concat hello, world 

like
### store it in `soni` variable

soni in_ha_mood like
### change `soni` value to in_ha_mood

( soni that boys_a_liar ) damn 
### compare in_ha_mood to boys_a_liar
### damn is a boolean == operator

then anthony in_ha_mood like a duhduhduh
### then takes the boolean evaluation
### and conditionally runs the code until duhduhduh

( soni grah )
### print the value of `soni`
```
